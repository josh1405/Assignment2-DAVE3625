I think Regression would work better for the Tesla usecase since we have a our 
dependent value Y which is the Close value and our independent input X which is the date. 
It is easier to see which variable has the most impact on our value Y. 
By having a good dataset and training the machine with regression means that it will be easier to predict what the value of the stocks are in the future.
